// ConMart — Proforma Line-Item Arithmetic
// =============================================================================
// Pure, client-safe pricing math shared by the live calculator in the buyer UI
// and the authoritative server-side proforma engine.
//
// Both must use this function. When the preview and the committed invoice were
// computed by separate copies of this formula, they rounded differently and a
// buyer could be shown a total that did not match the invoice they received.
//
// A preview is still only a preview: the server re-runs this against the tier
// price it reads from the database, so a tampered client cannot set its own
// price.
